# Slew-rate Controlled V Driver Validation Board

Addresses the high power consumption and noise issue of the V driver in r0.9 by implementing a slew-rate and dead-time controlled V driver

The KiCAD design files are lost, but the circuit design is basically the same as in the r0.9 release: `../../sensorboard-backport/`
